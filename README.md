### Inspiration:

> - Everyone and their dog have a big idea for the next hit app but most people lack the skills or resources to build them.
> - Having used some commercial app-building and prototyping tools in the past, we consider them inefficient as they don't reflect what the app is actually going to look like until it is run on a real device.

### What Appception does:

Appception allows you to build mobile apps on your iPhone through a simple drag and drop interface.
While building your app, it is always running and it has its own behaviors and states. 
With Appception, anyone can build apps that use the device's sensors, persist and retrieve data locally or remotely, and interact with third party services. 


### How it was built:

We built Appception with React Native. Using Redux, a predictable state container JavaScript library, we can handle the state of the user created app. 
We then designed a software architecture that allowed us to effectively isolate the states of the app builder and the user generated app, within the same iOS app. (hence App-ception) 
Appception communicates with a server application in order to deliver a generated app to the user.
